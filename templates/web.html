		<p id="just">A restaurant (sometimes known as a diner) is a place where cooked food is sold to the public, and where people sit down to eat it. It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal.
Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same food. McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut are examples of chain restaurants that are all over the world. These restaurants serve fast food, that is, inexpensive food, prepared and served quickly. At some, you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called drive-throughs.

There are also chain restaurants that serve slightly more expensive food. They are called fast casual restaurants. Applebee's and Perkins are examples of this type of chain restaurant.

Haute cuisine or 'fine dining' is found in a guide, such as the Michelin Guide, the most famous restaurant guide in the world. Their 3-star rosettes are given only to restaurants with the highest standards of cooking and service. Interestingly, the Guide gives more 3-stars to Tokyo and Kyoto than to Paris, London and New York together.[1][2] Traditionally, the restaurants of top hotels such as the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo or the HÃ´tel Ritz Paris were the main places recognized for fine dining. Today, most Michelin Guide restaurants are separate establishments.

		<p id="vegi">Vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal tissue products (such as gelatin or animal-derived rennet).[1] Lacto-ovo vegetarianism (the most common type of vegetarianism in the Western world) includes eggs and dairy products (such as milk and cheese without rennet). Lacto vegetarianism includes dairy products but not eggs, and ovo vegetarianism encompasses eggs but not dairy products.[2] The strictest form of vegetarianism is veganism, which excludes all animal products, including dairy, honey, and some refined sugars if filtered and whitened with bone char.[3] There are also partial vegetarians, such as pescetarians who eat fish but avoid other types of meat.[3]

There are a wide range of possible vegetarian foods, including some developed to particularly suit a vegetarian/vegan diet, either by filling the culinary niche where recipes would otherwise have meat, or by ensuring healthy intake of protein, B12 vitamin, and other nutrients.[4]

Cereals, grains, fungi especially edible mushrooms, seaweed, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts.
Soy products, including tofu and tempeh, which are common additional protein sources
Textured vegetable protein (TVP), made from defatted soy flour, often included in chili and burger recipes in place of ground meat.
Meat analogues, which mimic the taste, texture, and appearance of meat and are often used in recipes that traditionally contained meat.
Eggs and dairy product analogues in vegan cuisine (such as aquafaba, plant cream or plant milk).

			Non-vegetarian food (in Indian English sometimes shortened to non-veg food[1]) contains meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, or the flesh of any other animal), and sometimes, eggs. The term is common in India, but not usual elsewhere. In the generally vegetarian environment of India, restaurants offering meat and fish usually have a "non-vegetarian" section of their menu, and may include the term (typically as "Veg and Non-veg") in their name-boards and advertising. When describing people, non-vegetarians eat meat and/or eggs, as opposed to vegetarians.[2][3][4] But in India, consumption of dairy foods is usual for both groups.

The diet, non-vegetarianism[5] is the majority human diet in the world (including India).[6][7] Non-vegetarians are also called omnivores in nutritional science.[8]
